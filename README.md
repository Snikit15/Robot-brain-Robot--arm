The purpose of the project is to develop a reinforcement learning-based control system for a robotic arm using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. It aims to enable the robotic arm to learn and improve its movements and tasks in a simulated environment, allowing for more efficient and adaptive control. The project focuses on:

Implementing an effective control strategy for robotic manipulation.
Utilizing reinforcement learning to enhance the arm's performance through trial and error.
Integrating with simulation tools like Gazebo to test and refine the control algorithms in a virtual setting.
